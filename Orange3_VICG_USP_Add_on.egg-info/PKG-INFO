Description: Orange3 Example Add-on
        ======================
        
        This is an example add-on for [Orange3](http://orange.biolab.si). Add-on can extend Orange either 
        in scripting or GUI part, or in both. We here focus on the GUI part and implement a simple (empty) widget,
        register it with Orange and add a new workflow with this widget to example tutorials.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        To install the add-on, run
        
            pip install .
        
        To register this add-on with Orange, but keep the code in the development directory (do not copy it to 
        Python's site-packages directory), run
        
            pip install -e .
        
        Documentation / widget help can be built by running
        
            make html htmlhelp
        
        from the doc directory.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        After the installation, the widget from this add-on is registered with Orange. To run Orange from the terminal,
        use
        
            python -m Orange.canvas
        
        The new widget appears in the toolbox bar under the section Example.
